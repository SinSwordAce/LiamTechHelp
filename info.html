				<p>This right here is the first profile picture I had used anywhere and everywhere when I started spreading about on the internet, not the best but simple and cheap. Yes I did buy this from a school mate for like Â£5 when in year 7 and back then everyone was exploring youtube and streaming, so it didn't matter at the time but having your name as your profile picture wasn't such a good idea.</p>

				<h2>The Raid</h2>
				<p>While the world was beginning to fall, during one of my many streams while playing with my best friend on Halo:MCC, a very unexpected raid appeared and boosted my streaming career.

					<h2>Goal to Affiliate</h2>
					<p>After the raid, I started gaining followers a lot faster then I could believe and a few days after the raid. It happened, I got to Affiliate!</p>
					<img src="./images/GtA.webp" alt="Goal to Affiliate" width="300px">

				<div class="minibox">
					<h2>Commission</h2>
					<p>After a while of streaming and gaining more followers, I decided it was time for a profile picture upgrade. I was very into GTA Online at the time so I only needed to get someone to create my idea, I got to asking Remshia about doing a commission for me, as we had been introduced after I got affiliate.</p>
					<p><B>And I was not disappointed!</B></p>
